My personal website where I plan on having one simple html file with multiple style variations that load at random when you refresh the page. The concept came to me when I couldnt decide what I wanted my site to look like. I figure this way I can have many different designs all living in one place, and each version will explore different ways of laying out content using css grid and flexbox.
