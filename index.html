				<p>You've made it to my page <i class="em em-smile"></i>. My name is David Nu&ntilde;ez, and I'm a graphic-designer-turned-front-end-developer (gdtfed for short). 
          I graduated from Pratt Institute where I received a Bachelors in Fine Arts, specializing in Communication Design. 
          In the years following graduation I've worked in magazines, non-profits, start-ups, and small agencies. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As the years went on I realized I was slowly getting more and more interested in front end development, and finally made the jump when I joined Web.com (with the help of Generel Assembly).  
          I currently work on a number of marketing materials including too many responsive emails, one-off landing pages, and various marketing pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel comfortable with html, css, sass, git, and gulp. 
          I can defend myself with javascript and jquery and I'm constantly trying to polish these skills. 
          I'm constantly learning new things and I'm always looking for advice or mentorship. 
        </p>
