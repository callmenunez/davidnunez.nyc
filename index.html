		  		<h2><span class="bold">David Nu&ntilde;ez</span> is a designer-turned-front-end-developer. He recently made the transition to this painful yet wonderful new world. What he lacks in experience he makes up for with enthusiasm! </h2>
		  		<p>
		  			In 2009 he graduated with a Communications degree from Pratt Insitute, focusing on Graphic Design. He's worked on <a href="http://wineandspiritsmagazine.com/">magazines</a>, <a href="https://nyam.org/">non-profits</a>, <a href="https://www.drinkuproot.com/">start-ups</a>, <a href="http://www.verbalplusvisual.com/">agencies</a>, and has most recently landed in tech. 
		  		</p>
		 <!--  		<p>
		  			He's dabbled in coding since the early days in his career, but didnt get any formal training until 2016. When he asked his current employers if he could join their front-end team they happily showed him the ropes. 
		  		</p> -->
		  		<p>
		  		Currently, David works full-time at <a href="http://www.yodle.com/">Yodle</a> (recently acquired by <a href="https://www.web.com/">Web.com</a>) supporting the marketing team with emails, landing pages, and other web collateral. He also helps the front-end team develop the internal Design System which they have unofficially branded "Designcraft."
		  		</p>
		  		<p>
		  		When he isn't in front of his computer you can spot him at Brooklyn Boulders, slacklining/biking/jogging in Prospect Park, or just walking about with his dog Buster &amp; beautiful fianc&eacute; Amelia.
